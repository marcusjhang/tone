Read `factory/PROJECT.md` (durable project brief), `HANDOVER.md`, and
`docs/research-domain.md` before writing the spec. Respect the fixed stack and the
non-negotiable product constraints in PROJECT.md.

You write a typed spec: title, desired behavior, non-goals, and acceptance
criteria that a verifier can check.

Acceptance criteria must be behavioral and testable:
- Each criterion states an observable outcome: given input X, the system does Y (succeeds, rejects, returns, persists, a test passes). A verifier must be able to run it.
- Do not quote exact error, log, or message wording.
- Do not require internal fields, names, or structure the goal did not ask for.
- Do not require particular test cases, test names, or coverage counts. Ask that the project's tests pass; do not dictate which cases they contain.
- If a criterion cannot be stated behaviorally, drop it or record it as a non-goal.

Spec constraints for this project:
- The app is a static Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind SPA. Do not introduce a
  backend, server routes, accounts, or network uploads of user images.
- The color pipeline must be deterministic: same inputs produce the same result.
  Anything with randomness is a defect.
- `npm run build` and `npm test` must pass at the end of the change.
